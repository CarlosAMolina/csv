This folder analyzes a case that I cannot open correctly with Libreoffice.

## Workaround

[Reference](https://ask.libreoffice.org/t/import-csv-file-ignore-string-delimiter-while-importing/55999/17)

When the file is opened, in the `Text Import` options popup, modify the `String delimiter` as null, you can click in the current option and delete it.
